// What we try to achieve here is setting common lifetime for State and Future objects
// but using higher-ranked trait bounds (https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/trait-bounds.html#higher-ranked-trait-bounds),
// i.e. impossible to specify on the call side (see use of this trait).
// The effect is somewhat opposite to 'static lifetime, the lifetime shorter than anything passed by the user.
// Inspired by https://stackoverflow.com/a/63558160/3021277
