# Warp SDK

> ⚠️ Following library has been renamed from **[redstone-smartweave](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redstone-smartweave)** to **warp-contracts** from version **1.0.0**! If you are using older version please read [README-LEGACY](README-LEGACY.md).

Warp SDK is the implementation of the SmartWeave [Protocol](./docs/SMARTWEAVE_PROTOCOL.md).

It works in both web and Node.js environment (requires Node.js 16.5+).

It has been built with performance (e.g. caching at multiple layers, Arweave calls optimization)
and modularity (e.g. ability to use different types of caches, imported from external libraries) in mind.

We're already using the new SDK on production, both in our webapp and nodes.
However, if you'd like to use it in production as well, please contact us on [discord](https://discord.com/invite/PVxBZKFr46) to ensure a smooth transition and get help with testing.

To further improve contract state evaluation time, one can additionally use AWS CloudFront based Arweave cache described [here](https://github.com/warp-contracts/warp/blob/main/docs/CACHE.md).

## Architecture

Warp SDK consists of main 3 layers:

<img src="https://smartweave.redstone.finance/assets/img/illustrations/architecture.svg" height='50%' width='50%'>

1. The `Core Protocol` layer is the implementation of the original SmartWeave protocol and is responsible for communication with the SmartWeave smart contracts deployed on Arweave. It consists of 5 modules:
   1. `Interactions Loader` - this module is responsible for loading from Arweave all the interaction transactions registered
      for given contract.
   2. `Interactions Sorter` - responsible for sorting the interactions according to the protocol specification. This is crucial operation for the deterministic contract state evaluation.
   3. `Definition Loader` - this module loads all the data related to the given SmartWeave contract - its source code, initial state, etc.
   4. `Executor Factory` - this module is responsible for creating "handles" to the SmartWeave contract. These handles are then used by the SDK to call SmartWeave contract methods.
   5. `State Evaluator` - this module is responsible for evaluating SmartWeave contract state up to the requested block height.
2. The `Caching` layer - is build on top of the `Core Protocol` layer and allows caching results of each of the `Core Protocol` modules separately.
   The main interfaces of this layer are the:
   1. `WarpCache` - simple key-value cache, useful for modules like `Definition Loader`
   2. `BlockHeightWarpCache` - a block height aware cache, crucial for modules like `Interactions Loader` and `State Evaluator`.
      These interfaces - used in conjunction with cache-aware versions of the core modules (like `CacheableContractInteractionsLoader` or `CacheableStateEvaluator`)
      allow to greatly improve performance and SmartWeave contract's state evaluation time - especially for contracts that heavily interact with other contracts.
3. The `Extensions` layer - includes everything that can be built on top of the core SDK - including Command Line Interface, Debugging tools, different logging implementations,
   so called "dry-runs" (i.e. actions that allow to quickly verify the result of given contract interaction - without writing anything on Arweave).

This modular architecture has several advantages:

1. Each module can be separately tested and developed.
2. The SmartWeave client can be customized depending on user needs (e.g. different type of caches for web and node environment)
3. It makes it easier to add new features on top of the core protocol - without the risk of breaking the functionality of the core layer.

## State evaluation diagram

![readState](docs/img/readstate.png)

In order to perform contract state evaluation (at given block height), SDK performs certain operations.
The diagram above and description assume the most basic “mem-cached” SDK client.

1. Users who are interacting with the contract, call the “readState” method.
2. Interactions Loader and Contract Definition Loader modules are then called in parallel - to load all the data required for state evaluation. Both Interactions Loader and Contract Definition Loader first check its corresponding cache whether data is already loaded - and load from the gateway (either Warp gateway or Arweave one) only the missing part.
3. With interactions and contract definition loaded - Executor Factory creates a handle to the Warp contract main function (or loads it from its own cache)
4. With all the interactions and a contract handle - the State Evaluator evaluates the state from the lastly cached value - and returns the result to User.

## Warp transaction lifecycle

![transactionLifecycle](docs/img/warp_transaction_lifecycle.svg)

Warp SDK is just part of the whole Warp smart contracts platform. It makes transactions processing and evaluation easy and effective.

1. Our Sequencer assigns order to SmartWeave interactions, taking into account sequencer’s timestamp, current Arweave network block height and is salted with sequencer’s key.

2. Interactions are then packed by Bundlr which guarantees transactions finality and data upload reliability.
   The ability to directly process rich content

3. Transactions are stored on Arweave where they are available for querying.

4. The key component for the lazy-evaluation nature of SmartWeave protocol is fast and reliable interaction loading. Thanks to our gateway we guarantee loading transactions in seconds in a reliable way - it has built-in protection against forks and corrupted transactions. Our gateway enables fast queries and efficient filtering of interactions, which in effect greatly reduces state evaluation time.

5. Lastly, transactions can be evaluated either by our SDK or the evaluation can be delegated to a distribution execution network - a dedicated network of nodes (DEN). Multi-node executors network listens to incoming transactions and automatically update contract state.

### Installation

SDK requires node.js version 16.5+.

#### Using npm

`npm install warp-contracts`

#### Using yarn

`yarn add warp-contracts`

### Import

You can import the full API or individual modules.

```typescript
import * as WarpSdk from 'warp-contracts';
```

```typescript
import { Warp, Contract, ... } from 'warp-contracts'
```

The SDK is available in both the ESM and CJS format - to make it possible for web bundlers (like webpack) to effectively
perform tree-shaking.

#### Using web bundles

Bundle files are possible to use in web environment only. Use minified version for production. It is possible to use latest or specified version.

```html
<!-- Latest -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/warp/bundles/web.bundle.js"></script>

<!-- Latest, minified-->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/warp/bundles/web.bundle.min.js"></script>

<!-- Specific version -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/warp@1.0.0/bundles/web.bundle.js"></script>

<!-- Specific version, minified -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/warp@1.0.0/bundles/web.bundle.min.js"></script>
```

All exports are stored under `warp` global variable.

```html
<script>
  const warp = warp.WarpWebFactory.memCachedBased(arweave);
</script>
```

### Using the Warp Gateway

#### SDK version >= `0.5.0`

From version `0.5.0`, the Warp Gateway is the default gateway used by the SDK.
By default, the `{notCorrupted: true}` mode is used (as describe below).  
If you want to use the Arweave gateway in version >= `0.5.0`:

```ts
const warp = WarpNodeFactory.memCachedBased(arweave).useArweaveGateway().build();
```

#### SDK version < `0.5.0`

In order to use the [Warp Gateway](https://github.com/warp-contracts/sw-gateway) for loading the contract interactions,
configure the smartweave instance in the following way:

```ts
const warp = WarpNodeFactory.memCachedBased(arweave).useWarpGateway().build();
```

The gateway is currently available under [https://gateway.redstone.finance](https://gateway.redstone.finance) url.  
Full API reference is available [here](https://github.com/warp-contracts/sw-gateway#http-api-reference).

Optionally - you can pass the second argument to the `useWarpGateway` method that will determine which transactions will be loaded:

1. no parameter - default mode, compatible with how the Arweave Gateway GQL endpoint works - returns
   all the interactions. There is a risk of returning [corrupted transactions](https://github.com/warp-contracts/sw-gateway#corrupted-transactions).
2. `{confirmed: true}` - returns only confirmed transactions - the most safe mode, eg:

```ts
const warp = WarpNodeFactory.memCachedBased(arweave).useWarpGateway({ confirmed: true }).build();
```

3. `{notCorrupted: true}` - returns both confirmed and not yet verified interactions (i.e. the latest ones).
   Not as safe as previous mode, but good if you want combine high level of safety with the most recent data.

```ts
const warp = WarpNodeFactory.memCachedBased(arweave).useWarpGateway({ notCorrupted: true }).build();
```

More examples can be found [here](https://github.com/warp-contracts/warp-contracts-examples/blob/main/src/redstone-gateway-example.ts).

### Contract methods

- [`connect`](#connect)
- [`setEvaluationOptions`](#setevaluationoptions)
- [`readState`](#readstate)
- [`viewState`](#viewstate)
- [`writeInteraction`](#writeinteraction)
- [`bundleInteraction`](#bundleInteraction)

#### `connect`

```typescript
async function connect(wallet: ArWallet): Contract<State>;
```

Allows to connect wallet to a contract. Connecting a wallet MAY be done before "viewState" (depending on contract implementation, ie. whether called contract's function required "caller" info) Connecting a wallet MUST be done before "writeInteraction".

- `wallet` a JWK object with private key or 'use_wallet' string.

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```typescript
const contract = smartweave.contract('YOUR_CONTRACT_TX_ID').connect(jwk);
```

</details>

---

#### `setEvaluationOptions`

```typescript
function setEvaluationOptions(options: Partial<EvaluationOptions>): Contract<State>;
```

Allows to set (EvaluationOptions)

- `options` the interaction input
  - `options.ignoreExceptions` enables exceptions ignoring
  - `options.waitForConfirmation` enables waiting for transaction confirmation

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```typescript
const contract = smartweave.contract('YOUR_CONTRACT_TX_ID').setEvaluationOptions({
  waitForConfirmation: true,
  ignoreExceptions: false
});
```

</details>

---

#### `readState`

```typescript
async function readState(
  blockHeight?: number,
  currentTx?: { contractTxId: string; interactionTxId: string }[]
): Promise<EvalStateResult<State>>;
```

Returns state of the contract at required blockHeight. Similar to the `readContract` from the version 1.

- `blockHeight` Block height for state
- `currentTx` If specified, will be used as a current transaction

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```typescript
const { state, validity } = await contract.readState();
```

</details>

---

#### `viewState`

```typescript
async function viewState<Input, View>(
  input: Input,
  blockHeight?: number,
  tags?: Tags,
  transfer?: ArTransfer
): Promise<InteractionResult<State, View>>;
```

Returns the "view" of the state, computed by the SWC - ie. object that is a derivative of a current state and some specific smart contract business logic. Similar to the `interactRead` from the current SDK version.

- `input` the interaction input
- `blockHeight` if specified the contract will be replayed only to this block height
- `tags` an array of tags with name/value as objects
- `transfer` target and winstonQty for transfer

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```typescript
const { result } = await contract.viewState<any, any>({
  function: "NAME_OF_YOUR_FUNCTION",
  data: { ... }
});
```

</details>

---

#### `viewStateForTx`

```typescript
async function viewStateForTx<Input, View>(
  input: Input,
  transaction: InteractionTx
): Promise<InteractionResult<State, View>>;
```

A version of the viewState method to be used from within the contract's source code. The transaction passed as an argument is the currently processed interaction transaction. The "caller" will be se to the owner of the interaction transaction, that requires to call this method.

💡 Note! calling "interactRead" from withing contract's source code was not previously possible - this is a new feature.

- `input` the interaction input
- `transaction` interaction transaction

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```typescript
const { result } = await contract.viewStateForTx<any, any>({
  function: "NAME_OF_YOUR_FUNCTION",
  data: { ... }
}, transaction);
```

</details>

---

#### `writeInteraction`

```typescript
async function writeInteraction<Input>(input: Input, tags?: Tags, transfer?: ArTransfer): Promise<string>;
```

Writes a new "interaction" transaction - ie. such transaction that stores input for the contract.

- `input` the interaction input
- `tags` an array of tags with name/value as objects
- `transfer` target and winstonQty for transfer

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```typescript
const result = await contract.writeInteraction({
  function: "NAME_OF_YOUR_FUNCTION",
  data: { ... }
});
```

</details>

### Evolve

Evolve is a feature that allows to change contract's source code, without having to deploy a new contract. In order to properly perform evolving you need to follow these steps:

1. indicate in your initial state that your contract can be evolved like [here](https://github.com/warp-contracts/warp/blob/main/src/__tests__/integration/data/token-pst.json).
2. optionally you can also set in initial state `evolve` property to `null`.
3. write an evolve interaction in your contract, an example [here](https://github.com/warp-contracts/warp/blob/main/src/__tests__/integration/data/token-pst.js#L84).
4. post a transaction to arweave with the new source, wait for it to be confirmed by the network and point to this transaction when calling evolve interaction. Warp SDK provides two methods which ease the process (`save` for saving new contract source and `evolve` for indicating new evolved contract source) - you can see how they are used in the [following test](https://github.com/warp-contracts/warp/blob/main/src/__tests__/integration/basic/pst.test.ts#L128).

Please note, that currently you can use evolve on all the contracts - including bundled ones and WASM contracts (an example [in the test](https://github.com/warp-contracts/warp/blob/main/src/__tests__/integration/wasm/rust-deploy-write-read.test.ts#L228)). You can also bundle your `evolve` interaction. Bundling for saving new contract source is not yet supported.

### WASM

WASM provides proper sandboxing ensuring execution environment isolation which guarantees security to the contracts execution. As for now - **Assemblyscript**, **Rust** and **Go** languages are supported. WASM contracts templates containing example PST contract implementation within tools for compiling contracts to WASM, testing, deploying (locally, on testnet and mainnet) and writing interactions are available in a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/warp-contracts/warp-wasm-templates).

Using SDKs' methods works exactly the same as in case of a regular JS contract.

Additionally, it is possible to set gas limit for interaction execution in order to e.g. protect a contract against infinite loops. Defaults to `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (2^53 - 1).

```js
contract = smartweave.contract(contractTxId).setEvaluationOptions({
  gasLimit: 14000000
});
```

### VM2

It is possible to provide an isolated execution environment also in the JavaScript implementation thanks to [VM2](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2) - a sandbox that can run untrusted code with whitelisted Node's built-in modules. It works only in a NodeJS environment and it enhances security at a (slight) cost of performance, so it should be used it for contracts one cannot trust.

In order to use VM2, set `useVM2` evaluation option to `true` (defaults to `false`).

```js
contract = warp.contract(contractTxId).setEvaluationOptions({
  useVM2: true
});
```

### Internal writes

SmartWeave protocol currently natively does not support writes between contract - contracts can only read each others' state. This lack of interoperability is a big limitation for real-life applications - especially if you want to implement features like staking/vesting, disputes - or even a standard approve/transferFrom flow from ERC-20 tokens.

SmartWeave protocol has been extended in Warp by adding internal writes feature.

A new method has been added to SmartWeave global object. It allows to perform writes on other contracts.

1. The method first evaluates the target (ie. specified by the contractTxId given in the first parameter) contract's state up to the "current" block height (ie. block height of the interaction that is calling the write method) and then applies the input (specified as the secon parameter of the write method). The result is memoized in cache.

```
await SmartWeave.contracts.write(contractTxId, { function: 'add' });
```

2. For each newly created interaction with given contract - a dry run is performed and the call report of the dry-run is analysed. A list of all inner-calls between contracts is generated. For each generated inner call - an additional tag is generated: {'interactWrite': contractTxId}- where contractTxId is the callee contract.

3. When state is evaluated for the given contract ("Contract A") all the interactions - `direct` and `internalWrites`. If it is an `internalWrite` interaction - contract specified in the `internalWrite` ("Contract B") tag is loaded and its state is evaluate. This will cause the `write` method (described in p.1) to be called. After evaluating the "Contract B" contract state - the latest state of the "Contract A" is loaded from cache (it has been updated by the write method) and evaluation moves to next interaction.

In order for internal calls to work you need to set `evaluationOptions` to `true`:

```ts
const callingContract = smartweave
  .contract<ExampleContractState>(calleeTxId)
  .setEvaluationOptions({
    internalWrites: true
  })
  .connect(wallet);
```

You can also perform internal read to the contract (originally introduced by the protocol):

```
await SmartWeave.contracts.readContractState(action.input.contractId);
```

You can view some more examples in the [internal writes test directory](https://github.com/warp-contracts/warp/tree/main/src/__tests__/integration/internal-writes). If you would like to read whole specification and motivation which stands behind introducing internal writes feature, please read [following issue](https://github.com/warp-contracts/warp/issues/37).

### Performance - best practices

In order to get the best performance on production environment (or while performing benchmarks ;-)), please follow these simple rules:

1. Do NOT use the `TsLoggerFactory` - it is good for development, as it formats the logs nicely, but might slow down the state evaluation
   by a factor of 2 or 3 (depending on the logging level).
2. Use `fatal` or `error` log level, e.g.:

```ts
// configure the logging first
LoggerFactory.INST.logLevel('fatal');
// or
LoggerFactory.INST.logLevel('error');

// then create an instance of smartweave sdk
const warp = WarpWebFactory.memCached(arweave);
```

Logging on `info` or `debug` level is good for development, but turning it on globally might slow down the evaluation by a factor of 2.  
Keep in mind that you can fine tune the log level of each module separately. For example you can switch the `fatal` globally, but `debug`
for the `ArweaveGatewayInteractionsLoader` (in order to verify the load times from Arweave GQL endpoint). The names of the modules are derived from the
names of TypeScript classes, e.g.:

```ts
// configure the logging first
LoggerFactory.INST.logLevel('fatal');
LoggerFactory.INST.logLevel('debug', 'ArweaveGatewayInteractionsLoader');

// then create an instance of smartweave sdk
const smartweave = SmartWeaveWebFactory.memCached(arweave);
```

### Examples

Usage examples can be found in
a dedicated [repository](https://github.com/warp-contracts/warp-contracts-examples).
Please follow instructions in its README.md (and detail-ish comments in the examples files) to learn more.
There is also a separate repository with a web application [example](https://github.com/warp-contracts/warp-app).

We've also created an [academy](https://redstone.academy/) that introduces to the process of writing your own SmartWeave contract from scratch and describes how to interact with it using Warp SDK.

A community package - [arweave-jest-fuzzing](https://github.com/Hansa-Network/arweave-jest-fuzzing/blob/master/README.md) has been released thanks to Hansa Network to help SmartWeave developers write fuzzy tests.
